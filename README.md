Throughout the year, I have demonstrated a strong alignment with the "Manage Risk" goal by delivering stable, reliable solutions across core applications like SBLC, QP, and RTP/RFRF. I proactively resolved defects, implemented enhancements, and ensured zero rollback deployments — reducing operational and delivery risk. My independent ownership of complex stories like RTP/RFRF with no KT, combined with deep functional understanding of SBLC, Consumer, and PEI flows, minimized the chances of rework and supported continuity even in the absence of key personnel. By enabling BIX job scheduling for the CODS team, I helped mitigate data delivery risks, while my self-driven upskilling in core and advanced Pega topics further reduced key-person dependency in the team. Strategically, my innovation in proposing a case reduction idea with $200K+ in potential savings directly contributes to reducing system overhead and long-term scalability risk. Additionally, my involvement in employee engagement and leadership events has helped strengthen cultural stability and reduce attrition risk. Overall, my contributions reflect a consistent commitment to identifying, mitigating, and preventing risks — both at the delivery and organizational level.
